## 📋 Prerequisites

- A **non-rooted device** (this method works without root access)
- A **custom ROM** that supports **Keybox import functionality**

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

This method only works if your **custom ROM includes an "Import Keybox" option** in the **Miscellaneous** settings.  
If your ROM does not have this feature, you’ll need to use one of the root-based methods instead.

> 🚨 **CRITICAL:** Before using this method, make sure to **disable all spoofing options** related to Play Integrity Fix.  
> Any active spoofing (device props, fingerprints, etc.) will **interfere with the keybox import and cause integrity checks to fail**.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Check ROM Compatibility

1. Open **Settings** on your device  
2. Navigate to **Miscellaneous** (location may vary depending on ROM)  
3. Look for the option **"Import Keybox"** or **"Device Integrity"**  
4. If you do not see this option, your ROM does not support this method

---

### Step 2: Download the Required Keybox File

**Safe Sources:**
1. **https://integritybox2.vercel.app** – **Recommended** 
2. **https://github.com/pperez39/google-keys** – Verified GitHub source

## 🚫 Important Warning
### ❌ https://tryigit.dev/keybox/
This site has **multiple community reports** of uploaded keyboxes being stored and reused.  
For your safety, **do NOT upload your keybox here.**
   
---

### Step 3: Disable Spoofing (if any)

1. Turn **OFF all spoofing-related options**, such as:
   - Device model spoofing
   - `build.prop` spoofing
   - Play Integrity Fix-related toggles (LSPosed/Shamiko)
2. **Restart** your device after disabling them

> ✅ This step is crucial — spoofing will break the keybox import process.

---

### Step 4: Import Keybox

1. Copy the downloaded `keybox.xml` file to your device’s internal storage  
2. Go to **Settings > Miscellaneous**  
3. Tap on **"Import Keybox"**  
4. Select the `keybox.xml` file  
5. Confirm the import if prompted

---

### Step 5: Verify Play Integrity Status

⚠️ **WARNING:** Do NOT check integrity via third-party apps on custom ROMs, as it may lead to loss of integrity certification. Use only the Play Store app.

1. Open the **Play Store APP**
2. Tap on your **Profile Picture**
3. Tap on **'Settings'**, then tap **'About'**
4. Verify it shows Play Protection certification **"Device is certified"**
