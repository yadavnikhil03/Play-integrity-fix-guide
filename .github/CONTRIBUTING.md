Thanks for helping out! Here's what to keep in mind:

## Keep It Simple

- Fix typos, update links, improve clarity
- Don't add unnecessary files
- Keep images small (compress them first)

## What NOT to Add

- ❌ APK files, ZIPs, or executables
- ❌ Large uncompressed images
- ❌ Personal configs or device-specific hacks

Use links to official releases instead.
